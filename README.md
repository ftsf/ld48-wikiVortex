# ld48-wikiVortex
Get lost in a vortex of Wikipedia exploration, complete quests and escape form the vortex.

The game works by giving you a random Starting Page from Wikipedia's featured articles,
and 3 random "Quests" which are some words I picked that I thought might be fun.
Your goal is to navigate from the Starting Page to pages related to the 3 Quests, you can do them in any order,
you'll get a notification when you complete a quest and receive an additional 10 steps.
Once you've completed all the quests, you must return to the Starting Page,
however you can never revisit a page you've already visited,
so you'll need to plan a way back out of the vortex.

You can run this with `yarn start` or build it with `yarn package`

My first time using Electron, very rushed, hopefully some fun.
